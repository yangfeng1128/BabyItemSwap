     <p>It is all about saving for parents and babies. Things you do not need may be wanted by others.
     Baby item swapping is a very environmental friendly idea. </p>
     <p>
     I am a mom with a 1-year-old and am a big fan of used toys, baby accessories and clothes. 
     Babies go through these things at an incredible speed and most of them were barely used before being considered "not needed".

     I made this site on my own and hope it can be a small tool parents can use to exchange used baby items locally,
      or in long distance if you would like to pay a little bit for shipping.

     I hope this is helpful. Please contact me if you have any suggestions.
